#TODO:
Pull price data from internet so can calculate how many shares to buy to re-balance
Make it a web app (allocation tool)
Allow allocation percentages to be changed in some front-end format
Web app: contains info from TR's Money book
For each asset class in Money, assign a low-cost VG index fund, and backtest hypothetical portfolios
Pie chart, dynamically updated (another of Risk vs. Safety)
Challenge: find allocation that performs best (historically); leaderboard
Sponsored by TR & VG?
